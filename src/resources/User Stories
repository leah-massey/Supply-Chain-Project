Story:
As an admin, at a top level customer organisation, I want to view a list of my direct suppliers.

Spec:
Given a user [U] is present in a top level customer organisation [O]
And a organisation O has a  list of direct suppliers [DirSup]
When U requests a list of direct suppliers
Then a list of O's DirSup is returned

Test 1:
- Somehow create scenario that : when domain tries to look up company for ZU123 it gets back ZC789
- Somehow create scenario that : When domain tries to look up suppliers for ZC789 it gets back a supply chain that includes direct suppliers (ZS456)
- When a user queries the domain for the direct suppliers
- Then assert that reply ZS456
